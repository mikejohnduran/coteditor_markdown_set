# CotEditor Markdown Script Set

This is a set of scripts created in AppleScript to suppot Markdown document development in CotEditor. A few of the scripts are designed to utlitze the command line.

## Preview in Browser

This script uses 'Grip', by joeyespo, a command line server application that renders Markdown to HTML so you can preview your document before uploading to it to GitHub. You need Grip installed on your computer first and can do so with the following command:
	
```
brew install grip
```

## Export to HTML

This script also uses 'Grip' to convert the Markdown document you're currently working on to HTML. It saves the HTML under the same folder as the Markdown.

## Macros

Various command phrases used in Markdown that can be set to keybind for quicker use.
